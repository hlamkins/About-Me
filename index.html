        <p>My name is Heather Lamkins. I have been an operaitons manager for over ten years and have decided to take a leap and change my career path. This is by far, the scariest but most exciting thing I have done. I am currently enrolled in a Fullstack Software Development course. I want to learn to code because I have always had an interest in how computers work and how code can be used to create awesome things. I am looking for a change in careers because I want to feel challenged each day and management does not fulfill that need. </p>
      
        <br>

        <p>I was born and raised in the state of Minnesota and absolutely love everything it has to offer. I love the change of seasons every few months and have different things that I enjoy in each season. In my spare time I love to cook and bake. I have a sourdough starter named Clint Yeastwood that is over a year old and I bake with that almost every weekend. I love to try new recipes and perfect them whether it be a nice meal or a sweet treat. When I am not baking, I love spending time with my family and dogs outdoors. I enjoy fishing in the summer on the nice warm lake and in the winter on the frozen lake.</p>
